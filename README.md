Just a simple calculator, except for the possibility of input operations in words. Attention! Words are in ukrainian:  
"-" - мінус  
"+" - плюс  
"*" - помножити на  
"/" - поділити на  
"x**y" - x в степені y  
I don't know how calculator's logic works but my realization using recursion is not so bad (to my mind). Of course it will be pleasure for me to get useful recomendations how to improve my code.
